Let us (jduba@iastate.edu, joceo@iastate.edu) know if you are having trouble setting up the project.

Setting up DB:
- In MongoDB, create a database called `final` and a collection called `users`.
- Import backend/final.users.json to `users` collection.

Note:
- There is only one user at the moment, login functionality will be added before the final project is due.
- You cannot delete or create new workouts, but you can edit them.
