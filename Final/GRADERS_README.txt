Let us (jduba@iastate.edu, joceo@iastate.edu) know if you are having trouble setting up the project.

Setting up DB:
- In MongoDB, create a database called `final`
    - Create a collection called `users`.
    - Create a collection called `workouts`.

Running:
- Run `npm install` in both the `backend` and `frontend` directories.
- Run `npm start` in both the `backend` and `frontend` directories.

Enjoy! :)
