Setting up DB:
In MongoDB, create a database called `final` and a collection called `users`.

Note:
- We use a get request on our server to fetch data from an external API.
- We save the workouts (which are hardcoded into our frontend) to MongoDB which you can inspect.
- At the moment, we do not fetch the workouts from MongoDB, but we will do so in the next week.
- The delete workout button does not work yet on the My Workouts page.
