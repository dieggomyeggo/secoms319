          There are hundreds, if not thousands of different exercises a person
          can do in the gym for their specific muscle groups. Couple that with
          the fact that there are hundreds of millions of combinations of these
          exercises, which can be overwhelming for beginners. We wish to take
          that away, simplifying workout planning for every level of lifter.
